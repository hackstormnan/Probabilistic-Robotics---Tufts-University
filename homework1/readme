I undertook the challenge of delving into the intricacies of the Kalman filter algorithm to support a balloon drone grappling with operational intricacies. Throughout this endeavor, I diligently immersed myself in predicting and refining the drone's trajectory, considering complex variables like wind fluctuations and measurement noise.

My exploration led me to define essential state vectors, design transition probabilities, and skillfully execute state prediction steps. With careful consideration, I seamlessly incorporated GPS sensor measurements, accounting for Gaussian noise and enhancing state estimates. I navigated uncertainties adeptly, calculating expected errors stemming from potential sensor failures.

The inclusion of motor commands for movement prompted a revisit to earlier tasks, adapting them to encompass acceleration and wind influences. My project's culmination featured a comprehensive 2-D scenario analysis, highlighted by the visual representation of true versus estimated positions.

Within the attached PDF, you'll find my comprehensive responses, meticulous code implementations, and a helpful README guide. This achievement underscores my prowess in intricate algorithms, astute problem-solving, and adaptable programming proficiency.
